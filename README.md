# webpack-config-gen

Often times, I see novice Front End Engineers struggle through writing the webpack configuration customized for their Project.
Isn't there a cool GUI that helps users to select their transpilation, preprocessing, linting, etc., requirements and quickly generate a your webpack configuration object.

[Geneate Webpack Config for my Project](https://generatewebpackconfig.netlify.com/) lets you define your entry point, asset directory, transpilation you need, etc., and generates a minimal configuration that you could copy and include/extend the object in your Project.
